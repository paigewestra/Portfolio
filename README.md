# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. 

This site highlights some of my work as a student learning coding languages and it has been a cool way to see my progress with coding from scratch so far. 
    Within this site you may find: 
        - CSS
        - JavaScript


As a part of a web development course through a continuing education program at the University of Minnesota, each student created a website meant to house their portfolio. Through class, we added to it as we built our skills. Most of this code includes detailed commenting to help me remember prompts and thought-processes I was using to create working prototypes. 

Initial Prompt from Class Homework (Feb. 2021)

    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


    Notes on additions to site:
        - Ex. (*date*) "action".
