<!-- Prompt:
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
   
    WHEN I load their portfolio
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    
    WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section (this is similar to the first homework.)

    WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

    WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

    WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application

    WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport -->
